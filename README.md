# jobScraper
A simple web scraper tool. Built using beautifulsoup and the scraperapi
This web scraper tool will grab data from linkedIn (in this case, it will be software engineering jobs for new grads) 
and return all of the findings into a CSV file.

Here is an example of some of the data that was pulled:
